Usage
-----

To deploy a 1/1 Safe, call the `deploySafe` function with the `signerAddress`, a bytes32 value starting with the address of the signer, e.g. `0x38064551a016f1fe770d7fbbe1ee02afc9080260000000000000000000000000`

> [!NOTE] 
> This method does not support adding a salt and can therefore only be used to deploy a single Safe per address.
